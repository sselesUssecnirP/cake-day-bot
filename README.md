# cake-day-bot
A bot made to bring reddit Cake Days to discord.

## How-To:
Invite the bot using one of these links:

    [Admin Privileges](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=947111629378695209&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

    [User Privileges](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=947111629378695209&permissions=268511296&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

 If you invite it as a user, you run the chance of having to kick and reinvite it later if any new permissions are required for updates. 
 Inviting it as an admin ensures you don't run into the problem. Alternatively, you could host it yourself by cloning the repo. Eventually I may
 make a heroku template for the bot for easy hosting. Hosting it yourself, however, through Heroku or any other means you have would mean the uptime of the bot
 is entirely reliant on your setup. Heroku requires a paid dyno for 100% uptime and I'm unaware of any alternative besides buying a computer or running your own
 99% of the time.
